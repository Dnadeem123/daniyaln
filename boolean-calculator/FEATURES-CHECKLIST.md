## 🔬 Technical Implementation Details

### Expression Simplification
- **Algorithm**: Quine-McCluskey with Petrick's method for optimal prime implicant selection
- **Laws Applied**:
  - De Morgan's Laws: `¬(A ∧ B) = ¬A ∨ ¬B` and `¬(A ∨ B) = ¬A ∧ ¬B`
  - Distributive Laws: `A ∧ (B ∨ C) = (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C)`
  - Absorption Laws: `A ∨ (A ∧ B) = A`
  - Adjacency Law: `AB + AB' = A`
  - Idempotent Laws: `A ∧ A = A`
  - Complement Laws: `A ∧ ¬A = 0`
  - Identity Laws: `A ∧ 1 = A`

### Parser
- **Type**: Recursive descent parser with operator precedence
- **Precedence Order**: NOT > AND/NAND > XOR > OR/NOR
- **Features**: 
  - Implicit AND (juxtaposition): `AB` = `A AND B`
  - Parentheses for grouping
  - Postfix NOT notation: `A'` = `NOT A`
  - Mixed notation support in single expression

### Truth Table
- **Generation**: Exhaustive enumeration of all 2^n combinations
- **Display**: Clean tabular format with binary values
- **Optimization**: Handles up to 5 variables (32 rows) efficiently

### Karnaugh Maps
- **Gray Code**: Ensures adjacent cells differ by exactly one bit
- **Variable Grouping**:
  - Row variables: 0-2 variables
  - Column variables: 0-2 variables
  - Extra variable for 5-var (creates 2 maps)
- **Visual Coding**: Green cells (1), red cells (0)

### Circuit Diagrams
- **Library**: Mermaid.js (loaded from CDN)
- **Graph Type**: Directed graph (top-down flow)
- **Components**: Input nodes, gate nodes, output node
- **Gates Rendered**: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR

## 🧪 Example Test Cases

To verify all features work, test these expressions:

### Basic Operations
```
A AND B           → Simple AND gate
A OR B            → Simple OR gate
NOT A             → Simple NOT gate
A'                → Postfix NOT notation
```

### Complex Expressions
```
(A AND B) OR (C AND D)           → 4 variables, mixed operations
A' + B · C                       → Mixed notation
(A XOR B) AND (C OR D')          → XOR with other operations
```

### Advanced
```
A NAND B                         → NAND gate
(A + B) · (C + D)                → Distributive law demonstration
NOT(A OR B) AND C                → De Morgan's law applicable
A · B' + A' · B                  → XOR equivalent expression
